  <h2><i class="fa fa-bookmark"></i> About me</h2>
  <p>I am a natural language processing researcher at <a href="https://europe.naverlabs.com/">Naver Labs Europe</a> in Grenoble, France, 
    focusing on making recent NLP advances applicable across domains and languages.
    <br><br>
    Before joining NLE, I did my PhD on deep learning for source code processing at the
    <a href="https://cs.hse.ru/en/big-data/bayeslab/">Centre of Deep Learning and Bayesian Methods</a> of the 
      <a href="https://cs.hse.ru/en/">HSE University</a>, 
    where I was advised by <a href="https://bayesgroup.ru/people/dmitry-vetrov/">Prof. Dmitry Vetrov,</a>
    the head of our <a href="https://bayesgroup.ru/">Bayesian Methods Research Group</a>. 
    I received my Bachelor's and Master's degrees at  <a href="https://www.msu.ru/en/">Moscow State University</a>.
    My research contributed to the adaptation of NLP approaches to source code, the investigation of neural network ensembles properties,
    and the sparsification of recurrent neural networks.
  At HSE, I also taught machine learning to Bachelor and Master students for 6 years
    and was selected by students for the Best Teacher award 3 times.
  During 2017-2019, I've been one of the main organizers of the 
  <a href="http://deepbayes.ru/">Summer School on Deep Learning and Bayesian Methods</a>.  </p>
