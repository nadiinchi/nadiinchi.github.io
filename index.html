  <h2><i class="fa fa-bookmark"></i> About me</h2>
  <p>I am a deep learning researcher at <a href="https://bayesgroup.ru/">Bayesian methods research group</a> 
    supervised by <a href="https://bayesgroup.ru/people/dmitry-vetrov/">Prof. Dmitry Vetrov.</a>  
    I work as a research fellow at
    <a href="https://cs.hse.ru/en/big-data/bayeslab/">Samsung AI Laboratory</a> of the 
      <a href="https://cs.hse.ru/en/">Higher School of Economics</a>. 
  At HSE, I also teach machine learning to Bachelor and Master students.
  During last three years, I've been one of the main organizers of the 
  <a href="http://deepbayes.ru/">Summer school on deep learning and Bayesian methods</a>.  </p>
